### About Me

I'm currently learning Quantum Computing and Java. I've recently finished my Bachelors in Physics from [Sri Venkateswara College](svc.ac.in) affilated by [University of Delhi](du.ac.in). I always thrive to learn more. I'm always open to contribute, even if it's a small one, in the projects.
